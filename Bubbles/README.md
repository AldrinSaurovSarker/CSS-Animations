# Bubbles

This is a css animation to use as background in a webpage.
The animation shows some bubbles are popping in and out from the bottom of the screen to the top, like underwater.


(i) Number of bubbles:
Copy and paste '< img src="bubble.png" alt="bubble" >' this line or remove one line from "bubbles" class to increase or reduce the number of bubbles.

(ii) Bubble size:
Size of the bubbles can be varied from css. Just change the "width" property of "bubbles img:nth-child(n)".

(iii) Animation time:
Change the 2nd parameter of ".bubbles img" "animation" to a different time. Increasing it will reduce bubble speed and reducing will increase bubble speed.

(vi) Bubbles popping in time:
From "Animation-delay" property, it's possible to control when a bubble pops in.

(v) Background:
Background can be changed from "body". It won't affect the bubbles. Linear gradient is used for a dark shade on the background. You can change color or remove it 
completely.

(vi) Popin and popout position:
In "@keyframes bubble" in css, change "transform: translateY(x)" of 0% to any value to change the popin position of the bubbles and change in 100% for popout position.
